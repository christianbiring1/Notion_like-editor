# Notion_Like Editor

> Description of the project.

- I had to build a Notion-like editor, but only the H1 heading component. So it’s not much of an editor, but rather an app that lets the user write anywhere and convert their content into H1.

## Built With

- `ReactJS`
- `Bootstrap`
- `CSS`

## Live Demo (if available)

[You can check the live demo of my project here](https://christianbiring1.github.io/Awesome_books/)

`Install the third party library bu running the command`
- `npm install or npm i`
`Open up the project with the live server by running:`
